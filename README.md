# HTS_insilico_PCR
High-throughput screening of In silico PCR
This bash script aims to use Egon's perl script ((https://github.com/egonozer/in_silico_pcr) ) with hunderds or thousands of genomes. Absoultly, you should have good computer to do it!!

## Usage
Make sure that you have mafft (install it via conda or apt) !

Also, you should have the (*.fna) genomes files in the same directory as the perl and the bash script !

Type in your command line, then just answer questions !


```python

You will get unaligned amplicons and aligned amplicons with a tree
